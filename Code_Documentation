1. osmotic_m_Aw is growing to a very large number, osmotic_m_Ap is shrinking to zero
hence the difference is getting extremely large.

2. Checking for the face values of the scalar terms: The scalar keeps getting overcalculated

3. When the inlet concentration is on along with the inlet velocity, the range of values is well calculated and within 
	an expected range

4. When the bottom concentration is on then there was a segmentation error

5. temp1 and temp2 are escalating the values of the UDSI; dr (centroid distance between the neighbouring cell 
	and the boundary face)
