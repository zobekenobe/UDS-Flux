User Defined Function (UDF) for defining Scalar transport equations. 

Primary attempts:
Calculation of the scalar concentration at the permeable surface using the Robinson Boundary Condition
Estimation of the permeation flux through the permeable surface
Calculation of the PC layer thickness 
Scalar concentration 

The above code is written and formatted in the C language modified for the use with ANSYS fluent for CFD applications.
The above code has to be compiled first to prepare the linked libraries before use
